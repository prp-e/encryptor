# Encryptor

This [Ruby](http://ruby-lang.org) code, will help you to encrypt everything
you like, and how many times you want! Also, for ideas of using this script,
you can check my other projecy, [rsha256](https://github.com/prp-e/rsha256).

## Features

* Encrypts the string you entered in SHA2, 65536 times (default!).
* When you run the code, you can tell it how many times you want the string to be encrypted!
* Written in an easy and user-friendly language.
* Can be used for website backend, etc.
